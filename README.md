# Ge'ez font maker
Here's a [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%CA%BDez_script) on the Ge'ez writing system.
I've researched font making software and I haven't found one that allows for Ge'ez fidel(Ge'ez alphabet) font making. [Here's](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Font) a great article on the basics of fonts for Latin letters that English uses. 
All the fidel that is offered by Adobe and Google are serif fonts meaning that they have flourishes and extra decorative pieces to the fidel that makes learning the writing system more difficult than it needs to be. Serif font adds a layer of complexity and I want to add sans serif fonts for Ge'ez that is free to download and use on all electronics.  I order to add sans serif fonts I would need a software that can take vector illustrations for the letters and alphabets (264 total) of the Ge'ez writing system. 
## Research phase
I've learned that there's font making software for Latin alphabets. There's also open source communities that'll facilitate a faster software development.
